# InstantInvoice

A multi-tenant SaaS invoice management system built with **Laravel 10** and **Filament 3.0**. Each user registers, creates a company, and manages their own clients, invoices, payments, and projects — fully isolated from other tenants. Default currency is IDR (Indonesian Rupiah).

## Features

- **Invoice Lifecycle**: Draft → Sent → Viewed → Partially Paid → Paid → Overdue → Cancelled
- **Client Management**: Full profiles with type (individual/company), address, tax number, credit limit, and payment terms
- **Project Management**: Budget tracking, progress percentage, status flow, and invoice association
- **Payment Tracking**: Multiple payment methods, verification workflow, and receipt attachments
- **PDF Generation**: Professional invoice PDFs via DomPDF with QR code for quick client access
- **Public Invoice Links**: Signed, unauthenticated URLs so clients can view invoices without logging in
- **Export (CSV & XLSX)**: One-click export for Clients, Invoices, Projects, and Payments with raw numeric values
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Company-based isolation — each tenant has their own data, slug-based URL, and settings
- **Invoice Settings**: Configurable invoice prefix, default notes/terms, and branding per company
- **Tax Settings**: Per-company tax rates (percentage, fixed, or compound)

## Export

Each resource table (Clients, Invoices, Projects, Payments) has an **Export** dropdown button in the table header with two options:

- **Export CSV** — plain text, raw numeric values (no thousand separators)
- **Export XLSX** — Excel workbook, bold headers, auto-sized columns

Exported filenames follow the pattern:
```
{app-host}-export-{model}-{company-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmss}.{ext}
```

---

## PDF

Invoice PDFs are generated via DomPDF and include a QR code linking to the public invoice URL.

### Routes
| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /invoices/{invoice}/pdf` | Streams PDF (authenticated) |
| `GET /invoices/{invoice}/view` | Inline PDF view (authenticated) |
| `GET /invoices/{tenant}/{uuid}/pdf?signature=...` | Public signed URL for clients |

### PDF filename pattern
```
{app-host}-export-invoice-{company-slug}-{invoice-number}={YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmss}.pdf
```

### Browser tab title
```
{Company Name} - Invoice {number} - {app-host}
```

All filenames and titles derive the hostname from `APP_URL` in `.env` — no hardcoded domain.
